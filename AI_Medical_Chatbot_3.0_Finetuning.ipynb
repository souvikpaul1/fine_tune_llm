Answer the medical question below using your advanced knowledge.\\n\\n### Query:\\nA 61-year-old woman with a long history of involuntary urine loss during activities like coughing or\\n              sneezing but no leakage at night undergoes a gynecological exam and Q-tip test. Based on these findings,\\n              what would cystometry most likely reveal about her residual volume and detrusor contractions?\\n\\n### Answer:\\n\\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\\n\\n1. **Understanding the Symptoms:**\\n   - The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of involuntary urine loss during activities like coughing or sneezing. This is a common symptom of stress urinary incontinence (SUI), where the urethral sphincter doesn't fully relax during these activities, leading to small amounts of urine leaking out.\\n\\n2. **Examination Findings:**\\n   - She undergoes a gynecological exam and Q-tip test.\\n   - The Q-tip test is a diagnostic tool used to assess urethral function. It involves inserting a Q-tip catheter into the urethra and measuring the residual volume of urine in the bladder and the pressure generated during contraction.\\n\\n3. **Q-Tip Test Results:**\\n   - The Q-tip test can help determine if the patient is experiencing SUI. If the Q-tip remains in the urethra for an extended period after voiding, it suggests that the urethral sphincter is not opening properly, contributing to the involuntary urine loss.\\n\\n4. **Cystometry (Bladder Diary or Bladder Test):**\\n   - Cystometry is a more comprehensive test that evaluates how the patient's bladder and sphincter function during filling, storage, and voiding.\\n   - It can measure the residual volume of urine in the bladder, which is important because if the residual volume is too high, it can increase the risk of urinary incontinence.\\n   - Additionally, cystometry can assess detrusor contractions, which are involuntary contractions of the detrusor muscle (the muscle layer of the bladder). These contractions can cause an increase in intra-vesicular pressure, which may lead to urinary incontinence.\\n\\n5. **Expected Findings in Cystometry:**\\n   - **Residual Volume:** If the patient has a significant residual volume, it may indicate that her bladder isn't emptying completely during voiding, which can contribute to urinary incontinence.\\n   - **Detrusor Contractions:** The test will measure the strength and frequency of detrusor contractions. If these contractions are too strong or frequent, it can lead to an increase in intra-vesicular pressure, making it harder to suppress urination, especially during activities like coughing or sneezing.\\n\\n6. **Conclusion:**\\n   - Based on the findings from the gynecological exam and Q-tip test, cystometry would most likely reveal that the patient has a significant residual volume and detrusor contractions that are contributing to her symptoms of urinary incontinence.\\n   - The residual volume may not be fully emptied during voiding, and the detrusor contractions may be inadequate in preventing the increase in bladder pressure, leading to involuntary urine leakage during activities like coughing or sneezing.\\n\\n**Final Answer:**\\nCystometry would most likely reveal an elevated residual volume and increased detrusor contractions, contributing to the patient's symptoms of urinary incontinence.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Final Answer:**\\nCystometry would most likely reveal an elevated residual volume and increased detrusor contractions, contributing to the patient's symptoms of urinary incontinence.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\"]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(response[0].split(\"### Answer:\")[1])"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"khYZsy8E2wio","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1753877767276,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":21,"user":{"displayName":"Souvik Paul","userId":"09129305127919630343"}},"outputId":"94b6f120-95cc-4c7e-b618-5f72507c13ba"},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","\n","**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n","\n","1. **Understanding the Symptoms:**\n","   - The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of involuntary urine loss during activities like coughing or sneezing.

A woman comes in with a stab wound from a screwdriver. It's in her chest, upper border of the 8th rib, left side, kind of around the midaxillary line. First thought, that's pretty close to where the lung sits, right?\\n\\nLet's talk about location first. This spot is along the left side of her body. Above the 8th rib, like that, is where a lot of important stuff lives, like the bottom part of the left lung, possibly the diaphragm too, especially considering how deep the screwdriver went.\\n\\nThe wound is 5 cm deep. That sounds pretty deep. I mean, it could definitely reach down to the lung tissue or maybe the diaphragm. Given that it's midaxillary, we're in the territory where the lower lobe of the left lung hangs out. It's also possible there's some intersection with where the diaphragm begins, but the lung feels more probable somehow.\\n\\nNow, her vitals are concerning: elevated heart rate and low blood pressure. This is serious. My gut says that this kind of vital sign picture could mean something like pneumothorax or maybe hemothorax. Both can happen if the lung gets punctured, and they can make the blood pressure drop and the heart rate skyrocket since she's obviously distressed.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the most obvious culprit is the lower lobe of the left lung. The wound's depth and her condition point that way. And, yeah, this adds up with pneumothorax or maybe blood collecting in the chest—the kind of stuff that can really mess with breathing and circulation.\\n\\nAlright, with this in mind, it sure seems like the lung is the most likely thing that got hurt here. Makes sense given the situation, where the wound is, considering her symptoms, and the whole setup.\",\n"," 'Response': 'In this scenario, the most likely anatomical structure to be injured is the lower lobe of the left lung. The location of the stab wound—at the upper border of the 8th rib in the left midaxillary line—indicates proximity to the lower lobe of the lung. The depth of the wound (5 cm) suggests it is sufficient to reach lung tissue. Her vital signs of elevated heart rate and low blood pressure could signal complications like a pneumothorax or hemothorax, common consequences of lung trauma that would result from a penetrating injury in this area. Given these considerations, the lower lobe of the left lung is the most probable structure injured.'}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":13}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","EOS_TOKEN = tokenizer.eos_token  # Define EOS_TOKEN which tells the model when to stop generating text during training\n","EOS_TOKEN"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":36},"id":"k-3CV_AG2wqD","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1753879632370,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":48,"user":{"displayName":"Souvik Paul","userId":"09129305127919630343"}},"outputId":"d4ca19f4-ae2a-417e-d5c5-7b4dcc37c9e5"},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":14}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["### Finetuning\n","# Updated training prompt style to add  tag\n","train_prompt_style = \"\"\"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.\n","Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n","Before answering, think carefully about the question and create a step-by-step chain of thoughts to ensure a logical and accurate response.\n","\n","### Instruction:\n","You are a medical expert with advanced knowledge in clinical reasoning, diagnostics, and treatment planning.\n","Please answer the following medical question.\n","\n","### Question:\n","{}\n","\n","### Response:\n","\n","{}\n","\n","{}\"\"\"\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"RN5AGvT52wtH","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1753879639274,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Souvik Paul","userId":"09129305127919630343"}}},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","# Prepare the data for fine-tuning\n","\n","def preprocess_input_data(examples):\n","  inputs = examples[\"Question\"]\n","  cots = examples[\"Complex_CoT\"]\n","  outputs = examples[\"Response\"]\n","\n","  texts = []\n","\n","  for input, cot, output in zip(inputs, cots, outputs):\n","    text = train_prompt_style.format(input, cot, output) + EOS_TOKEN\n","    texts.append(text)\n","\n","  return {\n","      \"texts\" : texts,\n","  }"],"metadata":{"id":"rtaiKLHp2wwj","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1753880696000,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Souvik Paul","userId":"09129305127919630343"}}},"execution_count":24,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","finetune_dataset = medical_dataset.map(preprocess_input_data, batched = True)\n",""],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":49,"referenced_widgets":["b55e22421900455ca2d3dd2de6b945b9","6c61192e5c004cb3a48e373123eeb698","080674753593407d84c714ad2d475c7a","69601ce7a99649eba1386a3c082686b1","a669e066dd9146828964ccbd75bdad1e","e4acce50937f445d81471bbe2238ad20","0e318e06fcdc436282b19ce28aee8a8f","93e01f7109f84c67aa5d696a47cd596f","946daea7f8854be39270b783f11e86a4","22473cebcdee4afa93ffb21c1dddfae6","75475c017e6b4ff5b4448c0d4c4dced6"]},"id":"oPna5RJgKOzS","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1753880698061,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":51,"user":{"displayName":"Souvik Paul","userId":"09129305127919630343"}},"outputId":"6143734c-5528-4b60-ad36-717ac3bf7f21"},"execution_count":25,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["Map:   0%|          | 0/500 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]"],"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"b55e22421900455ca2d3dd2de6b945b9"}},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","finetune_dataset[\"texts\"][0]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":91},"id":"Tq9LLPUtKO1z","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1753879854708,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Souvik Paul","userId":"09129305127919630343"}},"outputId":"4ee1a401-e07f-4782-98e0-531b33750b91"},"execution_count":18,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["\"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.\\nWrite a response that appropriately completes the request.\\nBefore answering, think carefully about the question and create a step-by-step chain of thoughts to ensure a logical and accurate response.\\n\\n### Instruction:\\nYou are a medical expert with advanced knowledge in clinical reasoning, diagnostics, and treatment planning.\\nPlease answer the following medical question.\\n\\n### Question:\\nGiven the symptoms of sudden weakness in the left arm and leg, recent long-distance travel, and the presence of swollen and tender right lower leg, what specific cardiac abnormality is most likely to be found upon further evaluation that could explain these findings?\\n\\n### Response:\\n\\nOkay, let's see what's going on here.
